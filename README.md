## Why was this written?
Basically, I'm in Std. XII and I was assigned a project to make for the Boards.

## How you wrote this?
I wrote this for Turbo C++ 3.2, which is a C++ compiler running an older version of C++ and that's the reason for no `std` namespace and most C++ header files ending with a `.h`, in case you were wondering.
Also this project is under construction, more work on its way.

## How can I run this?
I use Linux for most of my programming, and there is an application called [dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/) which is an x86 MSDOS emulator which in my case runs Turbo C++ 3.2 without an issue.

## Is it any good for me?
No.
### I'm a programmer
Basically, I'm not a savvy programmer and I hate the idea of clean code and documentation but if you are okay with that and still want to check this out, I'll be very happy for you. See, if you can make sense of every line of code. And because it's a personal project I don't recommend a contribution, but I will always encourage one if possible.

### I'm not a programmer
I don't know why you're still reading this or how you found this repository, but if you're finding inspiration to start programming as a hobby, I heard `python` is a very good language!
